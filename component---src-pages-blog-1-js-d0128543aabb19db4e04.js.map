I am a\n          dog owner, so naturally I love seeing dogs prance around the city.\n          Recently there was a bunch of goats in my favorite park, and who\n          doesn't love that?. I'm tickled every time I see a raccoon. My data\n          set in this case in 311 data, so I'll be looking at complaints about\n          these creatures. I wanted to know which animals got under New Yorkers'\n          skin.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Rodents</h3>\n        <p>\n          On my block rats constantly scamper across the sidewalks at night. I\n          never see it as bad in other neighborhoods. I wanted to know if we\n          were alone. Some preliminary data, looking only at 2018 showed that my\n          zip code (10025) had the <b>most</b> rodent complaints of all zip\n          coddes in New York. I then got competitive and wanted to know who the\n          other offenders were and how the number of complaints has changed over\n          time. For example, if I see that they are coming down, the situation\n          might actually be getting better. To my dismay, the data says that in\n          my zip code has actually gotten much worse as the years have gone on.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For my visualization I wanted to start with worst offending zip codes.\n          Doing analysis on all zip codes would have created charts too large to\n          be useful, so I limited my data set to the ten worsdt offenders based\n          on comlaints over all fo the 311 data. I initially wanted to look at\n          worst by year, but when I plotted it by line chart seemed to be a\n          jumbled mess. It was simply uninsightful. Instead, I found it more\n          interesting to first look at the worst offending zip codes and then to\n          individually look at trends over time. I was able to include these\n          smaller charts in the tooltip as well as a map that shows you where\n          that particular zip code is within NYC.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Mosquitoes and Standing water</h3>\n        <p>\n          I am particularly prone to bug bites, and a few years ago I was\n          reading articles of mosquito infestations in thecity. The best defense\n          is to{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2016/03/zikaandwater/\">\n            not have any standing water\n          </a>\n          . This got me wondering if there was a relationship between standing\n          water complaints and Mosquito complaints. In order to analyze this, I\n          compiled the combined complaint count for mosquitoes and standing\n          water. I then looked at the ten zip codes with the most complaints.\n          From there I used a stack bar to easily look at trends. The ratio\n          between stading water complaints and mosquito complaints was very\n          inconsistent. I found this to be an interesting non-correlate. Since\n          zip codes are a non-obvious category, I included a map in the tooltip.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Illegal Pets</h3>\n        <p>\n          Two things made me want to look at complaints about illegal pets. The\n          first is that I'm a diehard Friends fan. In the show, Joey and\n          Chandler keep a duck and a chicken/rooster in their apartment. I\n          always wondered if anyone actually did this in NYC. Surprise, they do.\n          Secondly, I've always been tickled by a{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/nyregion/illegal-but-still-around-new-yorks-hidden-network-of-pet-pigs.html?src=twrhp\">\n            story I read\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          a couple of years ago about an underground network of pigs in the\n          city.\n        </p>\n      </>\n    </NotesOnProcess>\n\n    <p>Welcome to page 2</p>\n    <Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default SecondPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
