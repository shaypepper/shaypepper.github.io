Shoes like mine are only interesting when you can see them. I created a data set from online purchase data and a very helpful sales associate from the Fluevog store. I had the obvious price, location, date information for all of them. I did take some time to document heel height, colors, and a few other attributes. At the end of the day, I just didn't find those things interesting enough for a visualization.

One thing I felt strongly about was not using tooltips since it obscured the chart itself. This is where I began to explore Tableau actions. One thing I wanted was for a show to be highlighted in both charts if it was highlighted in the other. I also wanted an image of the shoe to exist embedded in the visualization. Basically, I wanted hover functionality without tooltips. This was tricky. I needed to create a workbook that had the photo and description of each shoe but was broken out into pages. I then needed this to be in the tooltips in each of the charts. Then I needed the tooltips to turned off on those charts. This linked everything together so that the photo could change in the upper righthand corner. The other thing that made this tricky was that on tableau desktop, the hover functionality actually doesn't work (!). Through some freak accident, I realized that it would work once it was uplodaed, just not on my desktop as I work on it."),n.a.createElement("p",null," ","Overall I really love that this visualization is simple and clean while including enough design to be impressive.
