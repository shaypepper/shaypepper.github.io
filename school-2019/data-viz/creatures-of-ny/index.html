        <p>I am always fascinated by non-human beings living in New York. I am a dog owner, so naturally I love seeing
            dogs prance around the city. Recently there was a bunch of goats in my favorite park, and who doesn't love
            that?. I'm tickled every time I see a raccoon. My data set in this case in 311 data, so I'll be looking at
            complaints about these creatures. I wanted to know which animals got under New Yorkers' skin. </p>



        <p>On my block rats constantly scamper across the sidewalks at night. I never see it as bad in other
            neighborhoods. I wanted to know if we were alone. Some preliminary data, looking only at 2018 showed that my
            zip code (10025) had the <b>most</b> rodent complaints of all zip coddes in New York. I then got competitive
            and wanted to know who the other offenders were and how the number of complaints has changed over time. For
            example, if I see that they are coming down, the situation might actually be getting better. To my dismay,
            the situation in my zip code has actually gotten much worse as the years have gone on. </p>


        <p>I am particularly prone to bug bites, and a few years ago I was reading articles of mosquito infestations in
            the
            city. The best defense is to not have any standing water. This got me wondering if there was a relationship
            between standing water complaints and Mosquito complaints. There doesn't seem to be at all, which I found
            interesting in and of itself.</p>
