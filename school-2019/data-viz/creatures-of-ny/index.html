            <h2>Notes on process</h3>
                <p>I am always fascinated by non-human beings living in New York. I am a dog owner, so naturally I love
                    seeing
                    dogs prance around the city. Recently there was a bunch of goats in my favorite park, and who
                    doesn't love
                    that?. I'm tickled every time I see a raccoon. My data set in this case in 311 data, so I'll be
                    looking at
                    complaints about these creatures. I wanted to know which animals got under New Yorkers' skin.</p>


                <h3>Rodents</h3>
                <p>On my block rats constantly scamper across the sidewalks at night. I never see it as bad in other
                    neighborhoods. I wanted to know if we were alone. Some preliminary data, looking only at 2018 showed
                    that my
                    zip code (10025) had the <b>most</b> rodent complaints of all zip coddes in New York. I then got
                    competitive
                    and wanted to know who the other offenders were and how the number of complaints has changed over
                    time. For
                    example, if I see that they are coming down, the situation might actually be getting better. To my
                    dismay,
                    the data says that in my zip code has actually gotten much worse as the years have gone on.
                </p>
                <p>For my visualization I wanted to start with worst offending zip codes. Doing analysis on all zip
                    codes would have created charts too large to be useful, so I limited my data set to the ten worsdt
                    offenders based on comlaints over all fo the 311 data. I initially wanted to look at worst by year,
                    but when I plotted it by line chart seemed to be a jumbled mess. It was simply uninsightful.
                    Instead, I found it more interesting to first look at the worst offending zip codes and then to
                    individually look at trends over time. I was able to include these smaller charts in the tooltip as
                    well as a map that shows you where that particular zip code is within NYC.</p>


                <h3>Mosquitoes and Standing water</h3>
                <p>I am particularly prone to bug bites, and a few years ago I was reading articles of mosquito
                    infestations in
                    thecity. The best defense is to <a
                        href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2016/03/zikaandwater/">not have any standing
                        water</a>. This got me wondering if there was a relationship between standing water complaints
                    and Mosquito complaints. In order to analyze this, I compiled the combined complaint count for
                    mosquitoes and standing water. I then looked at the ten zip codes with the most complaints. From
                    there I used a stack bar to easily look at trends. The ratio between stading water complaints and
                    mosquito complaints was very inconsistent. I found this to be an interesting non-correlate. Since
                    zip codes are a non-obvious category, I included a map in the tooltip.
                </p>

                <h3>Illegal Pets</h3>
                <p>Two things made me want to look at complaints about illegal pets. The first is that I'm a diehard
                    Friends fan. In the show, Joey and Chandler keep a duck and a chicken/rooster in their apartment. I
                    always wondered if anyone actually did this in NYC. Surprise, they do. Secondly, I've always been
                    tickled by a <a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/nyregion/illegal-but-still-around-new-yorks-hidden-network-of-pet-pigs.html?src=twrhp">story
                        I read</a> a couple of years ago about an underground network of pigs in the city.
